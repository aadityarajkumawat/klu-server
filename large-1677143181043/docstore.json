You can be competitor focused, you can be product focused, you can\nbe technology focused, you can be business model focused, and there are more. But in my view, obsessive\ncustomer focus is by far the most protective of Day 1 vitality.\nWhy? There are many advantages to a customer-centric approach, but here’s the big one: customers are always\nbeautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great. Even when they\ndon’t yet know it, customers want something better, and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent\non their behalf.

A customer-obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that\ncan happen.\nResist Proxies\nAs companies get larger and more complex, there’s a tendency to manage to proxies. This comes in many shapes\nand sizes, and it’s dangerous, subtle, and very Day 2.\nA common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers.

The process is not the thing. It’s always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own\nus? In a Day 2 company, you might find it’s the second.\nAnother example: market research and customer surveys can become proxies for customers – something that’s\nespecially dangerous when you’re inventing and designing products. “Fifty-five percent of beta testers report\nbeing satisfied with this feature.

If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less\ncostly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.\nThird, use the phrase “disagree and commit.” This phrase will save a lot of time. If you have conviction on a\nparticular direction even though there’s no consensus, it’s helpful to say, “Look, I know we disagree on this but\nwill you gamble with me on it?

In other words, if you\nhave high standards in one area, do you automatically have high standards elsewhere? I believe high standards\nare domain specific, and that you have to learn high standards separately in every arena of interest. When I\nstarted Amazon, I had high standards on inventing, on customer care, and (thankfully) on hiring. But I didn’t\nhave high standards on operational process: how to keep fixed problems fixed, how to eliminate defects at the\nroot, how to inspect processes, and much more.

I’m going to switch gears for a moment and talk about the\npast. How much value did we create for shareowners in 2020? This is a relatively easy question to answer\nbecause accounting systems are set up to answer it. Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of\nbeing a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single\nowner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020.\nHow about employees? This is also a reasonably easy value creation question to answer because we can look\nat compensation expense. What is an expense for a company is income for employees. In 2020, employees\nearned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of\n$91 billion.\nHow about third-party sellers?

They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were\nbetween $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.\nFor customers, we have to break it down into consumer customers and AWS customers.\nWe’ll do consumers first. We offer low prices, vast selection, and fast delivery, but imagine we ignore all of\nthat for the purpose of this estimate and value only one thing: we save customers time.\nCustomers complete 28% of purchases on Amazon in three minutes or less, and half of all purchases are\nfinished in less than 15 minutes.

We’re all busy in the early 21st century.\nSo that we can get a dollar figure, let’s value the time savings at $10 per hour, which is conservative. Seventyfive hours multiplied by $10 an hour and subtracting the cost of Prime gives you value creation for each\nPrime member of about $630.
